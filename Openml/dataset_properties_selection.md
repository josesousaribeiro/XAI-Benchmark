## Description of dataset properties by cluster

Seeking a better understanding of how the 15 properties characterize each of the clusters. Fifteen graphs were created, which allow a clear understanding of how value ranges of different properties are presented in each of the clusters in quantitative terms, Figure 1.

**Figure 1 - Frame with all properties plots.**

**1 - AutoCorrelation:** Existence of datasets with high values of autocorrelations in cluster 0 than in cluster 1. 

**2 - NumberOfInstances:** It is clear that this property did not present relevant differences in values for the two clusters.

**3 - Dimensionality:** It is clear that this property did not present relevant differences in values for the two clusters.

**4 - PercentageOfBinaryFeatures:** Cluster 0 has a high number of datasets with few binary variables, different from cluster 1 datasets. 

**5 - StdvNominalAttribute:** The datasets present in cluster 1 present fixed values for this property, that is, they are more uniform in this perspective.

**6 - MeanNominalAttDistinctValues:** The datasets present in cluster 1 present fixed values for this property, that is, they are more uniform in this perspective.

**7 - ClassEntropy:** It perceives the existence of a high number of datasets with high class entropy values ​​in cluster 1, that is, the existence of higher levels of information in these datasets.

**8 - NumberOfFeatures:** Existence of a greater number of datasets with smaller quantitative of attributes in cluster 1 than in cluster 0.

**9 - NumberofNumericFeatures:** Existence of a greater number of datasets with smaller amounts of numerical attributes in cluster 1 than in cluster 0.

**10 - NumberOfSymbolicFeatures:** The datasets of cluster 0 present concentrated values ​​of this property.

**11 - NumberOfBinaryFeatures:** The datasets of cluster 0 present concentrated values ​​of this property.

**12 - PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures:** Most of the datasets in cluster 0 have the lowest percentages of symbolic attributes.

**13 - PercentageOfNumericFeatures:** Most of the datasets in cluster 0 have high percentages of numerical attributes.

**14 - MajorityClassPercentage:** Most of the datasets present in cluster 0 have high imbalances between classes.

**15 - MinorityClassPercentage:** Most of the datasets present in cluster 0 have high imbalances between classes.


**However, from the inspection analysis performed above, it can be inferred that cluster 0 datasets are more complex than cluster 1 datasets.**
