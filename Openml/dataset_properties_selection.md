## Description of dataset properties by cluster

Seeking a better understanding of how the 15 properties characterize each of the clusters. Fifteen graphs were created, which allow a clear understanding of how value ranges of different properties are presented in each of the clusters in quantitative terms, Figure 1.

**Figure 1 - Frame with all properties plots.**

**1 - AutoCorrelation:** Note the existence of datasets with high values of autocorrelations in cluster 0 than in cluster 1. Indicating that cluster 0 has more complex datasets than cluster 1. 

**2 - NumberOfInstances:** It is clear that this property did not present relevant differences in values for the two clusters.

**3 - Dimensionality:** It is clear that this property did not present relevant differences in values for the two clusters.

**4 - PercentageOfBinaryFeatures:** Note that cluster 0 has a high number of datasets with few binary variables, different from cluster 1 datasets. 

**5 - StdvNominalAttribute:** It is noticed that the datasets present in cluster 1 present fixed values for this property, that is, they are more uniform in this perspective.

**6 - MeanNominalAttDistinctValues:** It is noticed that the datasets present in cluster 1 present fixed values for this property, that is, they are more uniform in this perspective.

**7 - ClassEntropy:** It perceives the existence of a high number of datasets with high class entropy values ​​in cluster 1, indicating the existence of higher levels of information in these datasets. As for cluster 0, smaller values ​​are noted.

**8 - NumberOfFeatures:** It is noticed the existence of a greater number of datasets with smaller quantitative attributes in cluster 1 than in cluster 0. This indicates that the datasets in cluster 1 are smaller and thus less complex.

**9 - NumberofNumericFeatures:** 

**10 - NumberOfSymbolicFeatures:** 

**11 - NumberOfBinaryFeatures:** 

**12 - PercentageOfSymbolicFeatures:** 

**13 - PercentageOfNumericFeatures:** 

**14 - MajorityClassPercentage:** 

**15 - MinorityClassPercentage:**
